        <h2>The Thin Hand</h2>
        <p>…After serving bravely, having handed over everything in a moment of ecstasy, in a show of her excusable haughtiness, she declares herself in rebellion. She announces that she will no longer sleep. One more time, she triumphantly repeats what has made her famous, and in her resurrection, gives us a flower...

            …Yet even with a simple cocoon, she shows us the iniquity of our temporary existence, the sterility of our obsession, the absurdity of our beliefs; a rose to despise, or better yet, to lay bare how little we have done for ourselves. How unfamiliar we’ve become with true serving, in fact, we never really offer ourselves when the cost of a humble request is so dear even for those most vulnerable.
